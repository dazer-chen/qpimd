WHY SSM

Benefis of PIM SSM over PIM SM
------------------------------

- SSM consumes minimum link bandwidth
- SSM simplifies multicast address management (specially important for
  inter-domain multicast)
- SSM does not suffer instabilities from traffic-driven SPT switchover
- SSM does not use RP. Some RP issues:
  - RP is possible point of failure
  - RP demands redundancy management
  - RP may require PIM dense mode support for RP election
  - RP is possible performance bottleneck
  - RP may demand lots of extra management

PIM-SSM drawbacks
-----------------

- SSM requires IGMPv3 support on receivers
- SSM may be memory intensive when managing (S,G) states for
  many-to-many multicast distribution
