KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Although bfdd supports mentioned drafts (see README)
some limitations are present:

- GTSM (Generalized TTL Security Mechanism) is supported
  for IPv4 based neighbors only if enabled during compilation.
  Which means there is no GTSM by default. Which together will a lack
  of authentication might be considered as a security hole.

- Building was tested only on GNU/Linux (debian 4.0) so it's rather likely
  that build will fail on different systems.

- Demand mode wasn't tested at all, mainly because nobody supports it right now.

- BFDD currently ignores interface add/del, address add/del messages
  from zebra with all of the consequences.
